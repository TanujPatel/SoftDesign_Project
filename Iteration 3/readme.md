# **Iteration 3:  Addressing Quality Attribute Scenario Driver (QA-3)**

## **Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers**
For this iteration, the  architect  focuses  on  the  QA-3  quality  attribute  scenario: 
The system server will stay running for 10 minutes after a power outage using the UPS we install, for users to back up data. The system will be running 24/7 for users to access multiple hotels and book hotels at any time.

## **Step 3 : Choose One or More Elements of The System to Refine**
For  this  availability  scenario,  the  elements  that  will  be refined  are  the  physical 
nodes that were identified during the first iteration: 
- Application server 
- Database server 

## **Step 4 : Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers**
