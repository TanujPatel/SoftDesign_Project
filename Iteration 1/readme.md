## **Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers**
The iteration goal is to achieve the architectural concern CRN-1 of establishing an overall system structure.
- QA-1
- QA-2
- QA-3
- QA-4
- CON-2
- CON-4
- CON-5

## **Step 3 : Choose One or More Elements of The System to Refine**
In this case the element to refine is the entire Hotel Reservation System. The refinement is performed through decomposition.

## **Step 4 : Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers**
