# **Iteration 2:  Identifying Structures to Support Primary Functionality **

## **Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers**
In this second iteration, besides CRN-2, the architect considers the system's primary use cases: 
- UC-2
- UC-5
- UC-10

## **Step 3 : Choose One or More Elements of The System to Refine**
The elements that will be refined in this iteration are the modules located in the different layers defined by the two reference architectures from the previous iteration. In general, the support of functionality in this system requires the collaboration of components associated with modules that are located in the different layers.

## **Step 4 : Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers**

## **Step 5: Instantiating Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Defining  Interfaces**

## **Step 6:Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions**

## **Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose**
The  decisions  made  in  this  iteration  provided  an  initial  understanding  of how functionality  is  supported  in  the  system.  The  modules  associated  with  the  primary use cases were identified by the architect,  and the modules associated with 
The  rest of the functionality  was  identified by  another team member. Also, as  part of module identification, a new architectural concern was  identified and added to the Kanban board.  Drivers that were completely addressed in the previous iteration is removed from the table.
